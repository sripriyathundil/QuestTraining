- Use pascal case name for class name.
- Use capital letter for constant.

## General Rules
- Add validation for all user inputs.
- Add comments where ever applicable.
- Do not write big methods.
- Use function parameters and return type to make code clearer and reuseable.
- Avoid code duplication.
- Avoid using system.out.print too much in the code.
- Always initialize variables and class members.
